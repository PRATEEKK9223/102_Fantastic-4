  📌 Problem Statement
Modern websites often go live without a thorough check on their security, performance, SEO, and accessibility. This leads to vulnerabilities, slow user experiences, poor search rankings, and usability challenges.
The Website Audit Tool solves this by scanning a website and generating a detailed health report covering:
Security risks (SQL injection, XSS, insecure headers, etc.)
Performance bottlenecks (slow resources, unoptimized media, etc.)
SEO gaps (missing meta tags, sitemap issues, etc.)
Accessibility issues (WCAG non-compliance, ARIA roles, etc.)
Along with identifying issues, the tool provides clear, actionable fixes.

💡 Example Scenario
Imagine a startup founder who has just launched a company website. While the site is live, they are unsure if it is:
✅ Secure from cyber threats
✅ Optimized for fast performance
✅ Ready to rank in search engines
✅ Accessible to all users

By using this Website Audit Tool, the founder can enter their website URL and instantly receive a comprehensive audit report. This report not only identifies problems but also explains how to fix them step by step, ensuring the site becomes safer, faster, and more effective.
